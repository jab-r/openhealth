<P>Why triples? It has been stated that an RDF based on 
triples is too low level to be useful. I cannot say whether triples are useful 
to any particular person for any specific purpose. I would like to suggest some 
questions that people may find useful in deciding whether triples and by 
extension RDF may be useful for a particular project or purpose.</P>
<P>In this article I consider RDF as a simplified XML infoset.</P>
<P>If triples are too low level to be useful as a basic on 
which to develop a predicate logic language, other candidates would be a pure 
text based syntax or an XML based syntax. The benefit of XML is not that it is 
often the very 'best' syntax for people to read or write but particularly that 
it is generally the best compromise as a syntax that is both human and machine 
readable. That was perhaps the initial reason why XML became as popular as it is 
today. I have absolutely no doubt that any particular piece of information 
encoded in XML could be similarly encoded in s-expressions but that has become 
an entirely moot point. Indeed the layout and transformation language that 
generally preceded XSLT was DSSSL - a derivative of Scheme. So certainly the 
developers of XML were well aware of Lisp. What has happened is that the web 
community has decided on the XML syntax and people are generally interested in putting up with any particular shortcomings of 
XML in the interest of being able to take advantage of the available software 
for parsing, manipulating, storing and transmitting XML.</P>
<P>Let us further examine the implications of developing a logic or for that 
matter any other, language on XML itself or alternatively on the RDF XML 
syntax.</P>
<P>XML 1.0 may represent directed labelled graphs. Representing trees is 
straightfoward and well accepted. Representing links in XML 1.0 can be done by 
entities. Yet entities add complexity to the XML abstract syntax and most real 
world interfaces (e.g. SAX, DOM, XPath) do not provide sufficient detail 
concerning such XML 1.0 constructs as entities (which require DTDs) in order to 
make XML 1.0 a reasonable platform itself on which to represent DLGs.</P>
<P>Additional facilities have been built on XML 1.0 to enable integration with the Web, namely the 
XML namespaces recommendation, RDF and XLink. The namespaces recommendation has been 
controversial for several reasons but particularly because of the lack of 
direction given toward what a namespace name URI reference ought reference. RDDL 
has emerged as a reasonable solution to this issue, one which models a namespace 
as a proper set of resources.</P>
<P>However namespaces&nbsp;do not easily work with DTDs, so accepting&nbsp;XML 
namespaces leaves the problem of how to represent DLGs in a namespace aware 
fashion.</P>
<P>XLink and RDF are both W3C recommendations aimed at answering this 
question.</P>
<P>The XML 1.0 abstract syntax&nbsp;is described by a set of 57 EBNF productions 
which themselves can&nbsp;be represented in XML/RDF [XSet]. Common programming 
level interfaces such as SAX, DOM and XPath used a simplified verion of this 
abstract syntax which generally corresponds to the XML Infoset. Much debate 
occurs as to what level of detail the commonly accepted subset ought capture. 
There is general agreement that whether an XML attribute is delimited by a 
single or double quote character is not important. Nor is the order of 
attributes. The fact that an information item is an attribute vs. element and 
the order of child elements is significant.</P>
<P>The RDF 'Infoset' or abstract syntax can be considered a yet simplified XML 
infoset where the origin of an item/object as from either an attribute or child 
element is not important, nor is the order of child elements (Syntactic 
conventions do enable cpature of order in rdf:Seqs).</P>
<P>What is gained by this simplification? An RDF abstract syntax can generally 
be stored in a single table with three columns. As such, the possibility exists 
to use RDF client side applications on handheld clients (for example) whereas 
the need to deploy a full XML enabled database would provide greater overhead. 
This, along with a simplified application and query model are the sole benefits 
of the triple model over the XML Infoset (or full XML grove) in their 
entirety.</P>
