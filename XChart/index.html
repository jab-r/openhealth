<P><B>XChart</B> is the Open Healthcare Group's XML-based open source electronic 

  healthcare system.</P>

<P>Despite the inherent inefficiencies and added costs, medical records are still 

  primarily paper-based. There are several good reasons why physicians 

  and other healthcare professionals remain tied to the old-fashioned pen and 

  paper. Paper-based systems still have several advantages over current electronic 

  medical records:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Paper is easy. You don't need any special software, 

  hardware or training.

	<LI>Paper is fast. It is generally quicker to document 

  encounters with a pen than with computer software.

	<LI>Paper is portable. Paper can be read and written 

  while on the move.

	<LI>Copies of paper records can be easily transferred to 

  other hospitals or physicians.

	<LI>There's no risk for a paper-based system to become 

  obsolete. Unlike computer-based languages, english and other natural languages 

  don't readily become archaic.</LI>

</OL>

<P>The Open Healthcare Group's <B>XChart</B> Project is a movement to create an electronic 
medical record that is <EM>easier than paper</EM>. 

<STRONG>XChart</STRONG> is a system 

  designed to combine the ease, speed and portability of paper systems with the 

  efficiencies of computerized records. XChart is browsable via the web with minimal training. XChart supports standards. </P>



<P>We have selected XML as a basis for the <B>XChart</B> repository because:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>It is becoming ubiquitous.

	<LI>It is easy to use.

	<LI>It is portable across operating systems and 

  languages. It is well specified hence allowing future generations to read 

  documents created today. It is available on nearly every platform in existence 

  with open source parsers available in nearly every language. It has a well 

  defined EBNF specification.

	<LI>XML can be transformed via XSLT into many presentation formats including 

  HTML for rendering within browsers and WML for wireless devices. Using XML, 

  a portable and ubiquitous information system can be created.</LI>

</OL>

<P> We have decided to create an open source implementation because we want as many people as 

  possible to use our system.We use Java servlets for the repository to 

  reduce particular operating system and hardware dependencies. All people should 

  have access to good healthcare, and all people should have access to good healthcare 

  software.</P>

<P>              

   We want to create healthcare software that is simple and easy to use with 

  minimal training. <B>XChart</B><B> </B>  will be intuitive and will operate 

  across a wide range of devices including desktop machines, laptops, and handheld 

  wireless devices.</P>

<P>     We have designed XChart around RDF to allow intelligent 

  agents to operate on the repository, enabling the next generation of medical 

  research.</P>

<P>The Open Healthcare Group is composed of medical and technology professionals. 

  We are actively seeking individuals and organizations who wish to collaborate 

  on this project and help us make the healthcare system better and more efficient.

  in joining the Open Healthcare Group Community.</P>

<P>A demonstration of a Java Servlet/XSLT based system which creates operative 

reports is available <A title="Opnote Generator" href="http://www.openhealth.org/opnote">here</A>.</P>

<P>We will be releasing a number of specifications and software projects which 

serve as a basis for the XChart project. Open Healthcare Group specifications 

are available <A title="Open Healthcare Group specifications" href="http://www.openhealth.org/specs.htm">here</A>.</P>
