This version circa 2/20/2000 implements javascript proxy generation of SOAP calls 
using XMOP object descriptors.

SOAPproxygen.asp?ProgID=YOUR.Component.1

generates a javascript SOAP proxy and allows:

var obj = new YOUR_Component_1("http://www.somewhere.org/SOAP/soapcall.asp");

var result = obj.SomeMethod("a",1,"b");

****Installation****

Unzip files to desired directories.

c/> regsvr32 delegate.dll
c/> regsvr32 mbxml.dll

testproxy.html assumes the default url:

http://localhost/xmop/soapcall.asp

ToDo:
