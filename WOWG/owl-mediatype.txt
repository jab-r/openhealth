Abstract

   This document describes a media type (application/owl+xml) for use
   with the RDF/XML serialization of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).
   OWL is intended to provide a language that can be used to describe
   the classes and relations between them that are inherent in Web
   documents and applications.

2. Introduction

   The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is intended to provide a language
   that can be used to describe the classes and relations between them
   that are inherent in Web documents and applications.

   The interchange language for OWL is the RDF/XML syntax [4] as
   described in the OWL Reference [1].  An OWL document may be served
   with the application/rdf+xml media type in which case the document is
   interpreted according to the application/rdf+xml media type [3]
   registration.  An OWL document may be served with the application/
   owl+xml media type in which case it is interpreted according to the
   value of the entailment parameter.  The value of the entailment
   parameter is a URI which references a model theory or other formal
   definition of which entailments are intended by the author or server
   of the document to be licensed by the client of the document.

      simple: the document is interpreted as simple RDF according to the
      RDF model theory.  The URIref for simple RDF entailments is http:/
      /www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#entail

      RDFS: the document is interpreted as RDF Schema according to the
      RDF model theory.  The URIref for RDFS entailments is http://
      www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#rdfs_interp

      lite: the document is interpreted as OWL according to the OWL
      direct semantics.  It conforms to the OWL Lite syntax.  The URIref
      for OWL Lite entailments is @@OWL Lite MT [10]

      DL: the document is interpreted as OWL according to the OWL DL
      semantics.  It conforms to OWL DL.  The URIref for OWL DL
      entailments is http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/direct.html

      full (default): the document is interpreted as OWL according to
      the OWL/RDF semantics.  It conforms to OWL Full.  The URIref for
      OWL Full entailments is http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/
      rdfs.html#5.4

   When an OWL document is served with the application/xml media type,
   no particular interpretation is indicated and must be arranged by

   private agreement between publisher and consumer of the document.
   Application/xml might be used when the document is intended to be an
   example.  The OWL model theory licenses additional entialments from
   the RDF model theory interpretation of the same RDF/XML document.
   Such differences between these interpretations are discussed in the
   OWL model theory document.

3. application/owl+xml Registration

   This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures [8]

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: owl+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameter: charset

         Same as charset parameter of application/xml.

      Encoding considerations:

         Same as charset parameter of application/xml.

      Optional parameter: entailment

         http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#entail: simple RDF entailments
         apply.

         http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#rdfs_interp: RDFS entailments
         apply.

         @@OWL Lite: OWL Lite syntax and entailments apply.

         http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/direct.html: OWL DL syntax
         and entailments apply.

         http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/rdfs.html#5.4 (default): OWL
         Full syntax and entailments apply.

      Security considerations:

         Security considerations include many of those described in
         section 10 of RFC 3023 [6] as well as those described in the
         application/rdf+xml media type registration [3].

      Interoperability considerations:

      Published specification: see Web Ontology Language (OWL) 1.0
      Reference [1] and OWL Abstract Syntax and Semantics [2] (working
      drafts as of 2002-11)

      Applications which use this media type:

         OWL is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported
         by a range of Web Ontology user agents, authoring tools and
         inferencing engines.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): none

            Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
            identify OWL, RDF documents will have the sequence "http://
            www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" to identify the RDF
            namespace.  This will usually be towards the top of the
            document.  OWL documents may or may not declare the OWL
            namespace "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"

         File extension(s): .owl,.rdf

         Macintosh File Type Code(s): "TEXT"

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Author/Change controller:

         The OWL specification is a work product of the World Wide Web
         Consortium.  The W3C and the W3C WebOnt Working Group have
         change control over the specification.

5. Fragment Identifiers

   application/owl+rdf uses the same fragment identifer syntax and
   semantics as application/rdf+xml.

   The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments
   in an RDF document.

   Section 4.1 of the URI specification [7] notes that the semantics of
   a fragment identifier (part of a URI after a "#") is a property of
   the data resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and
   interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type
   of the retrieval result.

6. Entailment parameter

   The optional entailment parameter is used to indicate which
   entailments are licensed by the publisher of the document to be
   derived from the assertions made in the document.

      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#entail: simple RDF entailments are
      licensed.

      Example use of this parameter as part of an HTTP GET operation:

         Accept: application/owl+rdf; entailment="http://www.w3.org/TR/
         rdf-mt/#entail" , application/rdf+xml

      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#rdfs_interp: entailments as per RDF
      Schema are licensed.

      Example use of this parameter as part of an HTTP GET operation:

         Accept: application/owl+rdf; entailment="http://www.w3.org/TR/
         rdf-mt/#rdfs_interp"

      @@OWL Lite: entailments as per OWL DL are licensed.  The syntax is
      intended to conform to OWL Lite.

      Example use of this parameter as part of an HTTP GET operation:

         Accept: application/owl+rdf; entailment="@@OWL Lite"

      Example use of this parameter as part of an HTTP GET operation:

         Accept: application/owl+rdf; entailment="http://www.w3.org/TR/
         owl-semantics/direct.html"

      http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/rdfs.html#5.4: entailments as
      per OWL Full are licensed.

      Example use of this parameter as part of an HTTP GET operation:

         Accept: application/owl+rdf; entailment="http://www.w3.org/TR/
         owl-semantics/rdfs.html#5.4"

      This value is the default if none is specified.


7. IANA Considerations

   This document calls for registration of a new MIME content-type,
   according to the registration template in section 2.
