<h2>2.1 Class Definitions </h2>
<p>The following definition defines a class as precisely the conjunction of a collection of superclasses and a collection of slot definitions.

/**
The next definition is the same, except that the defined class is an unspecified subclass of the conjunction. 
**/

/**
It is also possible to define a class as a set of individuals, as follows.

/**
Finally, it is possible to require that a collection of classes have the same members, or to be pairwise disjoint.

2.2 Property Definitions 
The following definitions make two properties be the same, or make one property be a sub-property of another. 
**/
SamePropertyAs ::= "samePropertyAs" ( Property )
SubPropertyOf ::= "subPropertyOf" ( Property )

/**
Properties can be given domains and ranges. The domain of a property is just a class. The range of a property is either a class or datatype range (a datatype or a set of data values). 
**/
Domain ::= "domain" ( Class )
Range ::= "range" ( Class )
DatatypeRange ::= "datatype" ( datatypeRange )

/**
There are also definitions that make properties single-valued (i.e., partial functions), make their inverse be single-valued, or make the properties be transitive. The latter two definitions also have the effect of making the properties have a range restricted to individuals.

2.3 Supporting Productions 
Superclasses are specified as one or more class ID's.

Slot definitions place restrictions on properties in classes. The range part means that all values must belong to class or datatype range. The modality part is either required, meaning that there must be at least one value for the property, or optional, producing no restriction. If the modality part is not present, there is no restriction. The multiplicity part is either singlevalued, meaning that there must be at most one value for the property, or multivalued, producing no restriction. If the multiplicity part is not present, there is no restriction. Each required part means that there must be at least one value for the property that belongs to the class or datatype range. Each value part means that the individual or data value must be a value for the property.

3. Fact Portion

/**
4. Non-Frame Portion of Definitions 
In non-frame definitions, there are many more constructs for providing characteristics of classes. These constructs create descriptions. As well there are relationships between descriptions, and more characteristics of properties. 

4.1 Class Definitions

4.3 Descriptions 
Descriptions include class IDs and the slot constructor. Descriptions can also be boolean combinations of other descriptions, and sets of individuals.
